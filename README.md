## Data Structures: Five Data Structures every Programmer should know

As Computer Programmer we program computers to manipulate data. Every computer program needs to store data  in various data structures for processing. Modern software programming languages and frameworks are so advanced that once common data structures are abstracted behind the scenes to make programmers life easier. 
Nonetheless, there are instances when we programmers can write more elegant programs and APIs if we know the data structures.

Here I am explaining 5 data Structures Every Programmer should know and excel.

# Linked List

Linked lists are the simplest and most common data structures. Linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.

Links list consist of Nodes and a pointer

Node has a value or data and a pointer which points to the next Node it connects to

## 1. Single Linked List


Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.

## 2. Double Linked List
# 3. Stack
# 4. Queue
# 5. Tree
## - Binary Tree 
## - Binary search tree (BST)
